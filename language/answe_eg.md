Process/Service.Anomalies

01. Abnormal Process Group

· Related Item: LSP
· Solutions:
  1. Enable "App Cloning" in settings (any app), the principle is creating user 999 to eliminate this detection point
  2. Update the system to the latest version (Android security patch date ≥ 2026-02-01)
  3. Update LSP modules to the latest version

02. Evil Service

· Related Item: Zygisk Next
· Solutions:

  · Magisk branch (Alpha/Kitsune): Enable "Force Mode/Unmount Injection Only" in Zygisk Next (may be ineffective on some devices)

03. Abnormal Process xxxx (PID)

· Feature: Usually an LSP process
· Solutions: Ignore / Uninstall LSP module / Manually identify the corresponding PID process (can be located via process tools)
